[x] Set font to DejaVu Sans and Mono. (Downloaded from [https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/Download.html](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/Download.html). I also tried a separate `fonts.css` through `@import`, but that did not work.)
[] Incorporate tweaks of [Sicalxy's fork](https://github.com/Sicalxy/typora-solarized-plus)
